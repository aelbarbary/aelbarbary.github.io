### Caching

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/mind.png)

Your body has a built in cache as well.

The concept of three levels of mind is nothing new. best way I have found to illustrate the concept of the three minds is by using a triangle. If you imagine at the very tip of the triangle is your conscious mind. It occupies only a small portion of space at the top, a bit like an iceberg where only a fraction of it is showing above the water. It probably represents about 10% of your brain capacity.

Below this is a slightly larger section that Freud called the preconscious, or what some refer to as the subconscious. It is much larger than the conscious mind and accounts for around 50-60% of your brain capabilities.

The section below this is the unconscious mind. It occupies the whole width of the base of the triangle and fills out the other 30-40% of the triangle. It is vast and deep and largely inaccessible to conscious thought, a bit like the dark depths of the ocean.

When you walk to the store, while your brain is recalling all the groceries items you need, your are walking in the same time without doing any effort to recall the walking instructions stored in your mind. "the waling process" is actually a part of the unconscious mind.

To software, The conscious mind is database base that contains all the entities that are relevant to the business. it is small in size but it is great in value. The subconscious and unconscious mind are the data and lookups that need to be easily accessible without doing much effort in order to take important business decisions. and that is your mind cache.

### Sharding

Imagine a apple tree where there is no branches. all the apples originated directly from the root. would this work ? would this scale ?

The concept of sharding is not new. it has been there for billions of years. every thing God designed is scalable in a smooth and magnificant way. The universe, the trees, the blood veins, the sperm inside the egg. the spider web. and your software should be no exception in this world :)
