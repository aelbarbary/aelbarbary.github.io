* Allows the data to speak for itself and allows to automatically update
your system.

### When ML is the right choice ?

* ML excels when the task requires many cases of weak evidences whose
importance is unknown or changing overtime.

### Machine Learning Process ... 4 steps

* Problem Framing: You get to know the context of your problem. you translate you business problem to a machine learning Problem
* Data Handling: You take the huge volume of raw data you have and you prepare for modeling step
* Modeling: Training the machine leaning model is the most technical step in the process
* Application: Put you application in production
