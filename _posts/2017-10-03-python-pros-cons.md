Before The cloud era, software engineers used to build system modules and services by hands. they needed strong and powerful tool to do such job. Java/C# is one of them.

* It only takes a few minutes to write a working program.
* Open access to huge variety of existing libraries and algorithms
* Very easy to get high performance when you need it (on a single machine)
