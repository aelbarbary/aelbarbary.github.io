## Simple ... Complex ?

#### Kinesis ![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/simple.png)
It is a a fully-managed streaming processing service thatâ€™s available on AWS.the only options you need to configure is number of shards and the number of days you need to keep the data.

#### Kafka ![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/complex.png)
is a fully managed AWS service whereas Kafka you have to manage it yourself. this makes Kinesis faster to integrate with your system with less errors/issues
