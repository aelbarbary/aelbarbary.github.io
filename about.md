I am an Egyptian/American, a husband, a father of tow kids (Zakariah and Aliah) and a software engineer who has passion solving interesting problems in the simplest and most maintainable possible way. I love to start with simple solutions even if it is less efficient. it is always easier to make a simple solution more efficient than changing/maintaining an efficient but sophisticated solution.

### More Information

I believe that:

* All that glitters is not gold
* Keep it simple
* Good things take time
